    description: "Design for a visual dashboard layered on top of the Mastra Orchestrator multi-agent routing system. Draft: orchestrator and 10-tool API run on the VPS; the dashboard UI is specified but not yet exported as an embeddable artifact on this page.",
    longDescription: [
      "The Mastra Orchestrator is a TypeScript-based multi-agent routing layer deployed on a Hetzner VPS and managed by PM2. A router agent reads incoming tasks, classifies them by reasoning depth and latency requirements, and dispatches to the best-fit model: Claude Opus for deep reasoning, Gemini Flash for fast search queries, and local models for drafting and summarization. The orchestrator and its 10-tool API are live on the VPS.",
      "The dashboard layer is the unfinished part. As designed, it would visualize the agent registry in real time: current task queue, per-agent latency histograms, message passing graph, and consensus state for tasks requiring multi-agent agreement. None of those views currently ship as embeddable artifacts on this page. The project lives at the API and rsync layer, not yet at the visualization layer.",
      "Agent state is already synced to /opt/david-sync via rsync every 60 seconds, making it readable from the Mac-side inbox system. This creates the two-way async channel: inbox directives flow from Mac to VPS, agent observations and task completions flow back. That is what the planned dashboard would visualize.",

      `A Python pipeline that runs ${PLOTTER.factories} independent factory generators, feeds each output through a scoring engine combining six algorithmic signals and five vision-language judges, and routes high-scoring pieces to the physical plotter. Factories span the full visual range: moire interference (highest avg), op-art warps, isometric voxel sculpture, density hatching, topographic line work, ridgeline waveforms, calligraphic gestures, generative grids, L-systems, stippling, wireframes, and more.`,

On top of those, five vision-language judges score the top pieces: Claude via subagents, Gemini twice (aesthetic + adversarial), Qwen via OpenRouter, and Cerebras. The full composite is 55% algorithmic + 45% judge.",

The loop has been running since the third week of March 2026.",

A piece that scores 88.3 on six algorithmic signals, top five of ${PLOTTER.kept}, can score 1.8 on a vision-language judge that calls it 'a degenerate parameter combination, no discernible composition, focal point, or visual interest.' The algorithm cannot tell the difference between a starburst and a piece of woven fabric. That is what the judges are for.`,
